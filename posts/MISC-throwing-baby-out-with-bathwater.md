In DEPTH, we'll control a democratic society which can thus fund things which are important, one of these being education.
In the current global social contract, it's typical that once you reach a certain age, general education stops and instead you work until you die, only
learning what is necessary for your narrow profession.

Democracy cannot function with people who stop learning. Therefore, DEPTH with its UBI and democratically allocated funding can institutionalize continuing
general education for all adults past college. 

One of the main things we'll need to learn is how to properly interact with each other and propose solutions. Looking at any twitter or Reddit conversation,
it's clear most of us could use a lesson or two in this area. On the side of interacting with one another, we could all learn how to avoid logical fallacies,
how to hear out one another, how to explain ourselves clearly and thoroughly without getting frustrated, how to be open minded while also knowing how to 
stick to what we are certain is right. On the side of proposing solitions, one example that sticks out to me is how common it is in human nature to 
throw the proverbial baby out with the bathwater. What I mean by this is humans see some problems and their solution is to dismantle the entire system, which
would more often than not result in a far worse outcome than leaving everything as-is. Some examples of this are:
- People see problems with inflation, with wealth inequality, with greed, and therefore decide we should get rid of money. Even though since the beginning of
  recorded history, people have been using money in order to efficiently trade as barter systems don't scale. The problem is greed and people abusing positions
  of power to co-opt money into something that enriches the few at the expense of the many; the problem is not money in general.
  DEPTH seeks to fix money's problems with democratic governance over how money is created and spent and even how it's distributed via UBI.
- People see problems with the criminal justice system, whether it's police brutality, dysfunctional prison sysems traumatizing inmates, or wrongful
  convictions, and the response is we should get rid of all police or get rid of jails. The problem is with bad police culture, and insufficient / wrongly
  spent resources, not with all justice systems in general.
  DEPTH seeks to fix the problems with justice systems by bringing them under democratic control, ensuring ethics is obeyed and money goes to where it's needed.
- People see many societies which called themselves communist fall into dictatorship with central planning leading to the starvation or genocide of millions,
  and therefore they conclude that all of communism the ideology has no merit. And yet some of the core concepts of modern society such as wellfare and labor
  rights are rooted in ideas first espoused by communism, and DEPTH itself is largely based on the ideals of a stateless society, ownship of capital by the
  people, and each person getting what they need regardless of their current economic output as a means to create a more humane society.
- Unfortunately the pattern or throwing the baby out with the bathwater even extends to the way we treat diseases. The common approach to treating cancer, chemotherapy, involves poisoning the entire body
  with the hope of killing the cancer. Cancer is the problem, not the whole body. DEPTH can play a role here too with its Transhumanist values; we can 
  democratically decide to fund new generic cancer treatments such as viral treatments which makes cancer recognizable to the immune system, or even better
  just invent technologies which permanently keep the human immune system as it was in your prepubescent years (before your Thymus turned to fat) and replenish telomere-shortened and senescent cells using stem cells such that your immune system will no longer lose its ability to kill early cancers.

So in conclusion, one of DEPTH's democracy's main goal should be to enable a hyper educated citizenry, and in doing so DEPTH will create a virtuous feedback loop.
If we bring eternal youth technology into the picture, then there'd be no downside to every human becoming a polymath as everyone would have the infinite time to
do so. I think a democracy run by billions of polymaths could easily reverse global warming and get us to a type 1 civilization within 100 years.

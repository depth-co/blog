# Exploring the DEPTH Values

Now that we've covered what DEPTH is, how it functions, and how it is implemented, we should discuss the core values which I plan to seed this network state with.
We'll cover this with an article on each of the members of the acronym
1. Democracy
1. Environmentalism
1. Pacifism
1. Transhumanism
1. Humanism

We've already covered how DEPTH's variant of on-chain democracy works at length. Before wrapping up the thoughts on democracy, though, we must cover the limitations of democracy and why DEPTH has any values at all.

If the aforementioned democratic system were perfect, if it were a perfect means to arrive at a perfect end, then there would be no need for DEPTH to exist; I could simply create a Topical Factional Liquid Democracy framework, release it into the wild, and it would on its own lead to the right outcomes over time. In practice though, we see that thoughout history democracies have been plagued by tyranies of the majority. When a democracy is established but the populace is either ill-informed, prejudiced and/or violent, easily swayed by charismatic demogogues, or unable to use critical thinking skills to differentiate fact from fiction, then the society at best is lead astray and wastes resources, and at worst it persecutes the innocent or wise/correct and moves the world backwards. We might look towards ancient Athens which democratically voted to execute the father or critical thought Socrates, or the Nazis which came into power through elections (albeit they were influenced by stormtoopers monitoring the polls). It is crucial then that for DEPTH to succeed, it must be seeded by the intellectually curious, and by those with sound ethics. Thus I am forming DEPTH as a means to acccomplish the world I know many of us want to create, whereas Topical Faction Liquid Democracy is the means which which I hope we get there, and you'll notice that framework has a pluggable interface for Factions, meaning that in the future democracy could be substituded for other means of governance. By picking individuals who align with DEPTH's values, our democratic experiment is more likely to turn out successfully. We'll build a society of polymaths whose holistic thinking can be the well-informed populace that a healthy democracy requires.

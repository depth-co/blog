# 002: (Take 1) Topical Factional Liquid Democracy

DEPTH seeks to be a global direct democracy. If we can achieve this, and seed the democracy with the right cohort of aligned starting members, I believe it will be possible to grow DEPTH
into the size I envision. Some properties must be present in order for this to work though
- Transparency is key. The outcomes of votes should be provably auditable by anyone in the world while also ensuring individuals' privacy
- 
- 

Summary:
- model after coalitions in parliaments
- give people control over all aspects while also retaining ability to delegate. Nobody has time to vote on everything but should be able to if they wanted to
- first past the post leads to known problems. Instead we want to allow people to percent vote on various options, and in the end not elect individuals but rather policies
- the problem with parties is that parties end up holding a group of incoherent views; ie democractic party is anti-cryptocurrency, anti-nuclear, pro immigration, pro welfare state, anti balanced budget. I'm pro nuclear, pro crypto, pro immigration, pro welfare state, pro balanced budget. By voting for Democrats I have to put up with the things I dislike to get the things I like. This leads to parties influencing the poltics of the masses rather than the other way around as it should be. Instead, votes should be topical. I can vote on different policies / factions based on the topic. For example 50% nuclear party, 50% green party for energy infra redevelopment, 80% forward party 10% libertarian party 10% democratic party on crypto issues, 100% progressive caucus for drug price negotiation, etc. The nice thing about topics is you can break each problem space into topics in a fan out manner all the way down to the microscopic decisions. Thus we gain full auditability over the entire decision making process. No longer will government resemble a "swamp" or "deep state" which spends or decides in ways that are incomprehensible or unaccountable.
- Don't elect people, elect policies. When a vote happens, that vote is made by the people and immediately takes effect since all rules live as on-chain smart contracts which govern all transactions between members of the society. There's no need for people sitting in a room saying "yea" or "nae". There's no need to spend any amount of time debating over whether politician X is authentic, because politicians have always been the middleman for enacting the policy desires of the public, and with TFLD, that middleman is bypassed (at least at the highest levels of decision making, at some point tasks will likely be delegated to smaller and smaller groups of individuals but at least this will all be auditable and malleable rather than being constrained by things like set term lengths of 4 years)

# Why DEPTH will Vote On-Chain

- With on-chain voting, we have mathematical certainties about the outcome of an election. Whereas in the US, half the nation believes there was wide-scale voting fraud and the [same side making that accusation actually tried to edit the vote count themselves](https://apnews.com/article/georgia-trump-indictment-voting-machines-conspiracy-theories-bc3db57cabd25fd8e335f85ed299e79c). Meanwhile in Russia there are claims of 90+% votes in favor of certain leaders or policies when everyone knows this can't be the case. Voting on-chain would bring guarantees to the outcomes of elections, and instantly too. No more waiting months for people to manually count votes and then recount them, and then recount them again just to get a different result (ie if Bush vs Gore went
differently there may have been no Iraq War and maybe a bi-partisan climate change strategy).
- We use bio signatures as keys to sign a voting transaction, such as an iris scan (worldcoin) or palm scan (Amazon One), so this guarantees one person one vote, prevents dead people from voting, and prevents voter disenfranchisement while still getting the benefits of a voter ID (since everyone has their body but not everyone has a drivers license). 

# 002: (Take 2) Topical, Factional Liquid Democracy

## Authoritarianism and Republics

When we think about why our systems fail us, what comes to mind?
Lack of transparency, incompetent leadership at the helm, corruption, poor ability to adapt to changing realities?
These all come down to problems of authoritarianism, lack of accountability, absolute power corrupting absolutely. 

Even when institutions start out democratic, they have a tendency to collapse into authoritatian rule over time: examples include ancient Athens, Rome, post cold-war Russia, perhaps the USA given the Jan 7th riots if they had succeeded in installing Trump as America's fist dictator,
modern day Israel and Turkey with both leaders suspending congress or hollowing out the judicial systems outlined by the original constitution.
Once people obtain power, corruption and/or conviction in one's cause incentivizes 
the power holder to tighten their grip on power. Even when this is not done by the supreme leader of a country, this pattern can be observed by representatives holding indefinite terms in office and becoming quite rich over time. They often end up compromising their original supposed values in order to retain power. For example avoiding pressure from AIPAC, trying to get donations to do their next campaign, in order to compromise with other leaders in their party, in order to ensure a comfortable retirement by colluding with monied interest. In practice one can face considerable consequences for actually voting for their purported values.

## The Challenges of Democracy and Liquid Democracy

Could we instead rule all things democratically? Where everyone has one equal vote on every matter? In practice this isn't feasible. It especially wasn't feasible in ancient times beyond the bounds of just a city (how could one person be expected to keep up on all minute details of governing a multi-region society and continue to work their job, how could they run a farm or shop or merchant route while also spending all their time in the capitol?) and so republics became the practical solution, but the republic always eventually collapses into an autocracy. Some of the problems with democracy have now been solved by the internet. Anyone anywhere anytime in the world can submit their opinion instantly without needing to travel to any special voting location. What the internet doesn't fully solve is the peoblem of people being able to keep informed with all things; while we do now have access to the collective information of humanity at the speed of light, our brains for now have a limited bandwidth for how fast we can learn, and there is too much nuance to every topic out there for everyone to be an expert at everything at all times.

A system known as liquid democracy was introduced to combat the remaining issue of people's lack of continuous attention / expertise. The idea is that every person can delegate to someone else for their voting, and they can change this delegation at any time. The idea is you would delegate to someone you trust and respect. If said person does not act according to your values, you can instantly change who you delegate to, or just vote on everything yourself. This system somewhat solves the problem, but not entirely. Really you're just delegating the decision making to someone else, and at some point you're still left with a single person controlling the votes of many attempting to make decisions on all matters out there which takes us back to the problems of authoritarianism (one person holds too much power which presents a susceptibility to corruption, and there's no way this one person could make good decisions on all topics). In addition, this system runs into a similar problem as traditional party politics: there's no way one person can ever be wholly represented by another party or person. Imagine for example an American voter named Susan. She:
1. Wants women to be able to get abortions up until they are 5 months pregnant, after that it should be illegal
1.  Is not a big fan of big government spending except for infrastructure. Perfers a balanced budget and minimized welfare spending (not a fan of handouts), minimized military spending, but is a big fan of building bridges, dams, and nuclear power, fiber optic, and more efficient power grids.
1. Believes America must switch to 100% renewables by 2025 in order to have a realistic chance of avoiding a cilmate disaster
1. Cares deeply about the plight of Palestinians
1.  Wants a secure southern border, and for all immigration to happen legally, even if that means constructing an impenetrable border wall

Is Susan represented by any party in America today? No. Point 1 sounds like a centrist Democrat position, but also maybe mainstream Republican in the sense that there should be an enforced limit to abortion. Point 2 isn't covered by any party today. Points 3 and 4 could probably be covered by left wing party like the Green Party or the DSA. Point 5 sounds like mainstream Republican, but if Susan voted for the Republican candidate she'd be compromising her values on points 1, 2, 3, and 4 so that's likely a non-starter. This is the conundrum of forcing someone to delegate to one other person or party for all matters. The result is either people undergo cognitive dissonance such that they start believing the party line no matter how paradoxical or counter to their beliefs, or they consider themself unrepresented; a majority of Americans consider themselves independent these days likely for this reason. It's important to note that independent here does not equate to being moderate. There's no "right" or "left", rather it's crucial to recognize there are many many topics and each comes with its own nuance and interplay with other topics, and individuals may be on a wide spectrum of combinations of various views.

It is clear then that while the instant redelegation ability of liquid democracy should be kept, we need to edit this such that someone can delegate to others based on topics. Such that I can delegate to person A for energy infrastructure, person B for monetrary policy, person C for foreign policy, etc.
The last problem that then remains with this tpoical liquid democracy is that delegation is going to a single person who may end up holding a large amount of power and thus can be corruptible.  

## Factions and Topics

So we've established that there's a need for each person to vote via delegation and this delegation should be based on different topics rather than someone delegating for all decision making. We should now introduce the concept of factions as a means to mitigate the issues with centralized power in specific individuals. We can think of factions as distinct groups for a given topic. They have opinions on how each subtopic of a topic should be handled. Sometimes these topics overlap

This nice propery about this is we suddenly have a system for delegating decision making from the most high level topics all the way down to the most minute of details.

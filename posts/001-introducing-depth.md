# Introducing DEPTH

In 2023, the challenges facing humanity require effective organization on a mass scale. Solutions to these problems require us to come together as a species, 
to find common solutions, to allow the goal of solving these most pressing challenges to supersede individuals' desires for power.

DEPTH seeks to solve problems such as Global Warming, wealth inequality, disease, violence, unnecessarily slow scientific progress, AI alignment, unnecessarily turbulent economic boom and bust cycles, 
structural prejudice, and corruption. DEPTH will solve these problems by establishing a new internet-based global direct democracy equipped with a built-in wealth tax and universal basic income for all its citizens,
with the eventual goal that DEPTH would someday provide a UBI and direct democracy to every human alive. To get there, DEPTH will function as a country with its own economy, producing every good and service that
exists today, selling these to global customers who share common cause. DEPTH will use the revenue and 10x its population each year until all are DEPTH citizens if they want to be and DEPTH's currency becomes
the globe's most valuable currency.

Before we dive into the details of the new political system being proposed and exactly how said system will solve each of the aforementioned problems, 
let's first begin with a call to action and a high level overview of what DEPTH is.

DEPTH stands for Democracy, Environmentalism, Pacifism, Transhumanism, Humanism. These are the values upon which I, Ozymandias hereby found this society.
DEPTH is, specifically, a type of Network State: a society in which individuals vote and transact and form binding contracts on the blockchain. 
We'll get into why a blockchain is necessary later.

It should be apparent to many that today's systems are inadequate for tackling the problems humanity faces. If you're like me, you know deep in your soul that in an age where all the world's
history and knowledge lies at our fingertips, where we can communicate and opine to anyone across the globe at the speed of light, in an age where we have the most educated
aggregate population in history hyper aware of the injustices and suffering each other faces, that we should be able to **quickly** solve global warming, corruption, and disease. 
And yet, what we observe corporations and governments colluding in obscurity to siphon the wealth of the globe for the benefit a wealthy few rather than the people they are supposed to serve, 
allowing any concern to the environment or the suffering of our peers and families go unaddressed if there's no wealth to be extracted. 
You and I both know a better way exists. I personally believe DEPTH is a concretization, a practical praxis, of one such better way. I call on you to join me in actualizing it.

DEPTH will be formed as a multinational C Corporation for legal status, but internally, it will function as a democracy and nation-state economy. Not as a democratic republic such as the USA or a 
totalitarian state disguised as a democracy like China, but instead a true democracy where each individual's vote is equivalent on all matters regardless of wealth or status.

Most companies are run in a capitalist model whereby shareholders appoint a board of directors which purposefully keep the scope of the company limited to a small set of things it
should focus on (do one thing well), then excess profits are sent away from the company as dividends rather than reinvested in rewarding the company's workers or in new socially transformative technologies.
DEPTH will not be run this way. DEPTH, as a society with a corporation just as an outer shell, will expand into all product and service categories. Every food, every software service,
every electronic component, every health product could in theory have a DEPTH alternative, meaning DEPTH could grow to an infinite size and over time replace large chunks of existing nations' economies. Imagine airplanes which are safe. Imagine journalism which is accurate and audited by the people.
Because DEPTH will be controlled democratically with the explicit goal of expansion over dividends, DEPTH can outcompete investor lead alternatives in each market.
Because DEPTH will be controlled democratically with the explicit goal of offering an ethical product, the businesses within DEPTH will be governed such that their negative externalities are curtailed, 
that they remain transparent (every decision and financial transaction is auditable on-chain), that overall they lead towards a more whole and just world as voted on by DEPTH citizens.
As an example, imagine DEPTH-based military defense products which protect lives without ever killing anyone sold to only the most ethical world actors to uphold international humanitarian law.

In DEPTH's internal economy, individuals can start entrepreneurial endeavors and sell goods and services to the outside world or internally. DEPTH tokens
will be exchanged internally as the nation's currency, and whenever a DEPTH-based entity sells something to the outside world, the cash collected will be exchanged for DEPTH on the 
open market. This would drive DEPTH to become a suction for talent and investment on our terms.
Because DEPTH is based on the blockchain, all assets of DEPTH citizens are tracked as cryptocurrencies and NFTs. There can be an automated system whereby a portion of 
every citizen's assets are granted to the DEPTH treasury periodically (the world's first automated and accurate wealth tax), and then 
redistributed equally to each citizen as a truly valuable universal basic income. Citizens may start entities outside of DEPTH, but pledge some percent of profits to DEPTH such that they can remain a citizen. 
DEPTH citizens would enjoy privileges in addition to 1 person 1 vote. For one they'd take part in history as DEPTH fixes the
world's major problems. In addition, there would be an internal cap on profit margins for products and services sold internally, and a means by which profits
from the areas you vote towards funding are returned to you; this system thus
- solves price gouging via a vertically integrated supply chain (as internal goods and services must be exchanged at near-cost)
- solves the problem where you have to be rich to get rich by opening up venture investing to everyone (since voting + buying = investing)
- solves the problem where governments historically balloon debt and have inefficient agencies by tieing each person's vote to the financial performance of 
  said solution that they voted on.
For example, imagine cures for cancer or Alzheimer's being given away to citizens for pennies, since DEPTH will own all the means of production from the lab equipment to the IP of the treatments to the inputs of
the drug. Such benefits will draw in additional skilled labor.

We'll have a "DEPTH Solves X" series later but the above is to get a taste of scope of just how holistic I believe DEPTH can be. In the future, I suspect DEPTH's bend toward Transhumanism will result in one of the first available treatments to holistically arrest / reverse human aging, and at that point we would have everyone lining up at the doors to become a citizen to receive the treatment at-cost.

Over time as DEPTH becomes more and more powerful, several phenomena could occur:
1. People sick and tired of working for "the man" would flock to DEPTH where the citizenry would democratically pass resolutions such as 4 day work weeks,
   work from home for all jobs where possible, better profit sharing rights, more democracy required in the workplace, and where ultimately people could work
   somewhere which gives them a sense of deep purpose rather than a feeling of working to make a rich asshole richer.
2. Unions which fail to strike deals with their bosses would come bring their skills to build under the DEPTH banner instead where they would no longer have to 
   face underhanded tactics in order to get what is fair to them, as they would become the owners of their business and government.
3. A brain drain from research institutions and science labs would occur to join DEPTH's alternatives where science is done with ethical means and ends, where
   education is adequately funded by the democratic masses, where educational institutes optimize for education quality rather than extractive tuitions and underpaid staff
4. Due to the above mentioned points, DEPTH would begin to amass a critical advantage in technological capabilities having acquired the world's top software,
   hard engineering, legal and scientific / intellectual minds.
5. Due to the above and to the UBI which shares the wealth generated with all citizens, DEPTH would see a host of art talent from around the world producing 
   art for DEPTH, thus turning DEPTH not only into a technology leader but a cultural one as well, thus creating a feedback loop of ever expanding circles
   of points 1 through 5.
6. Eventually citizens of all nations would see the appeal and elect to become a citizen of DEPTH, and because DEPTH would have a policy of taking everyone in (10xing it's population each year),
   DEPTH would become the legitimate successor to most if not all existing countries, where at some point the percent of DEPTH citizens in each country outnumbers the non-DEPTH citizens.

I am creating DEPTH because I often hear the cries for justice go unanswered. And my time studying the past and present have lead me to conclude there is
a deeply flawed nature in the way we have organized as humans so far. Often times the response by people when confronted with the deep systemic flaws of corruption and incompetence in how societal decisions are made is a response of "we must dismantle the existing system so we can create a new one!". The problem here is what is needed is a system that will replace the dismantled one. Often times there are some hints at what this new system might be, but usually the given descriptions of a replacement are vague or left as an exercise for those who succeed in the dismantling of the current system. The problem is this is an attitude that produces totalitarian successor states; idealistic revolutionaries overthrow the existing power which opens a power vaccum and a strongman fills the void under the guise of the ideology they're actually usurping power from. And so either you create the evil you tried to defeat by revolting, or, as is most likely the case in highly advanced nations today, the risk of destroying the current system seems untenable to most everyday people; people with families with stable incomes would much rather tolerate the problems of the existing system than gamble on a revolution. So what we must do with DEPTH is provide the alternative system, provide the answer to the question: "what comes next?". We will build up DEPTH such that it runs as a successful role model 21st century society in parallel to existing governments, and once it is ready, governments will recognize DEPTH as a superior and modern system and thus hand over the keys to the castle in a peaceful transfer of power.

As of the past few hundred years, humans have finally begun to practice democracy-like institutions (capitalism is a quasi-democratic institution depending
on local laws and wealth distribution) on
a grand scale, and the results have been promising, from the alleviation of poverty to the industrialization to the age of the computer. Though we are still
yet to unlock democracy's full potential. In 1776, America had no choice but to go with a republic as the closest representation of democracy as there was no way
all citizens of the former 13 colonies could travel to Washington DC to cast votes every other day; that wouldn't have scaled. But in the age of the internet, we
all can vote from our phones from anywhere on Earth. The day that true direct democracy is possible on a global scale has finally arrived.

In the next article we'll go over the details on how DEPTH will achieve it's goals. The new political system, the automated on-chain direct democracy.
I call it Topical, Factional, Liquid Democracy.
